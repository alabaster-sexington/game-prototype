RANDOM EVENT IDEAS

Hire Specialist (weather presenter, sportscaster, etc.)
Choices: Hire/Don't Hire
If hire: fixed cost over fixed period of time, fixed influence gain over fixed period of time.

Foreign Conflict Reporting
Your goverment is supplying arms to one side in a foreign conflict.
Choices: Report favourably on goverment side of conflict/inversigate govt spending or report POV of other side
Consequence: Instant (small) shift to authoritarian or libertarian for society (not publication)

Hire Security
If society is sufficiently authoritarian/libertarian, this event may trigger.
Hire: costs some fixed amount over a fixed period of time
Don't Hire: There is some low probability (higher with higher libertarian/authoritarian) that the news HQ is raided by outlaws in a subsequent event, causing you to lose half of your money and be downgraded one level of reach (international -> national, etc.) since HQ is destroyed.

Sensationalization/Clickbait
Frequency: appears once per game
If you wish, you can begin to sensationalize news headlines, which in turn unlocks more sensational news events.  Required for MechaHitler, etc.
