RANDOM EVENT IDEAS

Each event should be accompanied by some sort of story or flavoured text. Semi random. Chosen from a list. Give an engaging story, tell the player what’s happening. But, overall, the effect of the economic downturn/upturn is the same. The basic idea is that every turn there is some x percent chance that an event will happen, it picks some random event to happen from a list, and then the player reacts to it.

The game should be able to schedule certain events, and there should be some flexibility on how events are triggered. Certain conditions will have to met in order to trigger other events. These things should all be fair play, and you should be able to use any of these conditions.

Event trees should be done “behind the scenes”, but the events that occur to the player should be obvious as to why this is happening. Events 

Economic Downturn
Player is warned 3-6 months in advance.  Effective over 1-3 year period.  Income decreases 25-50%, publication influence over society increases slightly (more desperate times).

Economic Upturn
Effective over 1-3 year period.  Income increases 25-50%, publication influence over society decreases slightly.

Hire Specialist (weather presenter, sportscaster, etc.)
Choices: Hire/Don't Hire
If hire: fixed cost over fixed period of time, fixed influence gain over fixed period of time.

Foreign Conflict Reporting
Your goverment is supplying arms to one side in a foreign conflict.
Choices: Report favourably on goverment side of conflict/inversigate govt spending or report POV of other side
Consequence: Instant (small) shift to authoritarian or libertarian for society (not publication)

Hire Security
If society is sufficiently authoritarian/libertarian, this event may trigger.
Hire: costs some fixed amount over a fixed period of time
Don't Hire: There is some low probability (higher with higher libertarian/authoritarian) that the news HQ is raided by outlaws in a subsequent event, causing you to lose half of your money and be downgraded one level of reach (international -> national, etc.) since HQ is destroyed.

Sensationalization
Frequency: appears once per game
If you wish, you can begin to sensationalize news headlines, which in turn unlocks more sensational news events.  Required for MechaHitler, etc.  Warning: can cause the game to spiral out of control.

Tech Victory (ripoff of Civ games)
Extremely rare: 1 in 1000 chance that it even appears in a given game.  Requires Sensationalization.  Requires International Reach.  Requires 20 total Luck, 20 total Truth, 20 total Creativity, 20 Total Speech.
Your publication reaches a level of influence over society such that you are effectively supreme dictator of humanity.  Over a series of events, you may choose to found a private spaceflight company, divert funds to it from the paper, and once it has been funded with $100 billion, launch a flight which 5 years later will land humans on Alpha Centauri, at which point you get a Game Over with only the words 'You Win' displayed on the screen.  Unlocks an acheivement.  Not that anyone will ever see it.
